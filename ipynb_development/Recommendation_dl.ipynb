       "  'text': 'Murray to make Cup history\\n\\nAndrew Murray will become Britains youngest-ever Davis Cup player after it was confirmed he will play in the doubles against Israel on Saturday.\\n\\nThe 17-year-old will play alongside fellow debutant David Sherwood against Israels Jonathan Erlich and Andy Ram. Murray will eclipse the record set by Roger Becker back in 1952. Greg Rusedski takes Tim Henmans place as first choice in the singles, while Alex Bogdanovic will play in the second singles clash. Rusedski will take on former world number 30 Harel Levy and Bogdanovic - who has previously played in two singles rubbers against Australia - will face Noam Okun.\\n\\nMurray is the brightest young hope in British tennis, after winning the US Open junior title last year and the BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year. British number one Tim Henman, who announced his Davis Cup retirement earlier this year, believes Britain can win the tie in Tel Aviv. Its going to be as really tough match. Israel have some really good players - and their doubles pair of Andy Ram and Jonathan Erlich are among the top eight in the world - but I fancy our chances, he said. But Henman urged Bogdanovic, who has had run-ins with British tennis officials in the past, to seize his chance. Alex is a quality player - hes young but hes got to keep pushing forward. Hes got to be stronger, hes got a lot of ability but hes got to be more disciplined mentally and physically and if he does that hes got a good chance.\\n',\n",

       "  'text': 'Brown comes out shooting\\n\\nLabour may have abolished hunting - but that didnt stop Chancellor Gordon Brown using his Budget to fire both barrels at some of the opposition parties core election foxes.\\n\\nSpecifically, it saw him attempting to slaughter the council tax as an election issue and to tear limb from limb their wider policies for pensioners and families. In a relatively short speech he kept the best for last and was clearly out to give exactly that pre-election boost everyone had been predicting. So if you are a couple with children, a pensioner, a patient or a youngster, there was something pulled from Mr Browns red box in an attempt to persuade you to stick with or switch to a New Labour government. Like a surgeon, he attempted to target his handouts with absolute precision onto exactly the groups the government needs to appeal to in the election campaign.\\n\\nThe announcements brought great cheers from his own MPs who are now in full-on election mode and had been looking to their man to give them ammunition for the doorsteps. They obviously believed he had done that for them and, coincidentally, given his own image as a prime minister-in-waiting another little boost.\\n\\nLabour MPs, for example, will undoubtedly now engage in a debate over exactly how redistributive - a lovely Old Labour word - this chancellor really is. But Gordon Brown is never going to put on a show and even as he was out to cast himself as the man who will win Labour an historic third term, his demeanour remained quiet, confident and reassuring. Prudence made an appearance, albeit towards the end of his address, as he assured voters he would do nothing to mess up the economic stability he had brought to Britain and which, he claimed, would be thrown away by anyone else. According to the opposition parties, however, it is all one big con trick.\\n\\nAs always, they accused him of glossing over the facts of the black hole at the centre of his finances which, they claim, would ensure tax increases after the election. He did it most obviously with his increase in national insurance contributions after the 2001 election campaign during which he had pledged not to increase income tax. As Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy claimed, for most families the distinction between income tax and a tax on income is meaningless.\\n\\nTory leader Michael Howard said the chancellor was up to his old trick of deliberately re-casting his forecasts to give the illusion that everything in the Treasury larder is as fresh as the day it was first stored away for future use. He branded it a dodgy vote now pay later budget based on dodgy figures from a dodgy government that gave Britain the dodgy dossier. Where the chancellor mostly avoided direct electioneering, Mr Howard felt no such constraint with attacks like comparing Mr Browns forecasts to the prime ministers forecasts on Iraqs weapons of mass destruction. As ever, there will now be a period of frantic activity by the opposition parties treasury specialists as they pore over the chancellors red book, which sets out the fine detail of his budget, in an attempt to spot the flaws. In particular there will be an argument over precisely whose policies on the council tax will offer people the best deal. And in Labour circles there will undoubtedly be an argument over just how good a prime minister Gordon Brown will make at some point after the next election.\\n',\n",

After two years of total commitment with the Davis Cup team... I have taken this difficult decision to concentrate on the regular circuit, said Moya. They know that after this season they can count on me again if they so wish. The 1998 French Open champion is determined to make an impact in the major events after spending much of the last eight years in the top 10. At the age of 29 I have set some tough goals in my professional career and this season I need to fix my objectives on specific dates and tournaments, he said. Since the Davis Cup in Seville I have been working on my condition as well as technical and medical aspects of my game which will allow me to come into the big events of the year in top form.\\n\\nMoya began 2005 with victory in the Chennai Open on Sunday.\\n',\n",

But World Indoor 800m record holder Ceplak said: There is never an easy race when she is in the field. There is only excitement at what might happen. It is good for the sport. She always fetches the best out of everyone. Ceplak has been a great rival of Holmes during the Britons career and the pair fell out when Holmes questioned the manner of the Slovenians runaway 800m victory at the 2002 European Championships. But the controversy has since been forgotten, with Ceplak acting as pacemaker for Holmes failed attempt on the British Indoor 1500m record at the Norwich Union Grand Prix in Birmingham in 2003.\\n\\nCeplak added: I like running against her - you know the race is always going to be fast. That is the sort of competition that I like. She is special to me. She was like my idol from the beginning of my career. Meanwhile, Ceplak will be looking to follow up last Saturdays win in Boston with a fast time and victory in Fridays Night of Athletics in Erfurt, Germany. Britains Jason Gardener had been expected to defend his 60m title in Erfurt but instead he will save himself for a competition in Leipzig on Sunday.
